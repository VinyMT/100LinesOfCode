### IDEA
I got this idea when i was looking at the windows calculator and i saw a mode dedicated to programmers on it, basically what this mode does is convert any number to hexadecimal, binary, octal and decimal. Of course i did something much simpler, but still useful, my converter only converts from binary to decimal.

### IMPLEMENTATION
The software basically gets each character from the text in the text field, converts it to an integer, and does the operation to convert the binary number to its decimal equivalent. Then, the label from the UI has its text set to the result when the convertion is finished.
